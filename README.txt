Hello! 
My name is Victoria Lim, and resources from my graduate thesis project (Material Point Method for Mochi) can be found here. 

A PDF of my research paper can also be found in this repository. 

SIMULATION CODES will be added to this repository gradually.

ANIMATIONS of the simulations will also be added to the following YouTube playlist.
