Hello! 
My name is Victoria Lim, and resources from my graduate thesis project (Material Point Method for Mochi) can be found here. 

A PDF of my paper can be found in the main branch of this repository. 

SIMULATION CODES will be added to this repository gradually.

ANIMATIONS of the simulations will also be gradually added to the following YouTube playlist.
